A simple web application to keep track of my finances!

## How the idea started?

I had another web application hosted in the same domain that I used for keeping track of simple finances. This application used the IndexedDB local database along with Firebase to save and share my incomes and expenses, but it was not a complete finance app.

After some years, I started using some mainstream apps to control my finances, including some paid apps available on Play Store, but I found that these apps were missing some key aspects related to how I control finances myself, hence the idea to create a new app that would fill the gaps I found accordingly with my needs.

## How is this app different from other apps?

* Most apps does not support operations for lending money to someone else. Since lending money cannot be a source of income, neither an expense, and mostly not a transfer between your own self accounts, this app introduces the concept of **external accounts**. External accounts represents an entity (a person or a company) in which transfers to them (or from them) are expected to be paid back. So the app keeps track of how much you owe them, or how much they owe you.

* **External accounts can be shared** by creating a simple unique link, allowing other people to keep track of these operations too.

* We know that money transfers can mean different things, from simply organizing your accounts or lending money to someone because of a specific reason. In this app, it is possible to **associate categories and a subcategories to transfers between accounts**, similar to what is done with incomes and expenses.

* Credit cards are useful, but credit card purchases are usually hard to keep track because what you buy today can be paid in subsequent months. For this, the app supports **transaction views**. You want to see how much you paid this month, or how much new debts you created this month? It is up to you to chosse.
